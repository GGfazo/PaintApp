# PaintApp
A currently very rudimentary app where you can paint. Developed using c++ and the libraries SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf.

# Special thanks
Thanks to everyone who contributed to the development of c++ and the one of this specific libraries. This would not exist without them.

# Installation
## On Windows
1. Choose a desired path
2. ```git clone https://github.com/GGfazo/PaintApp.git```
3. ```cd PaintApp```
4. Now make sure to download and extract the following zip files into the directory (I use the devel-VC):
    1. [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/tag/release-2.28.5)
    2. [SDL image](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image/releases/tag/release-2.6.3)
    3. [SDL ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases/tag/release-2.20.2)
5. Now rename the folders to 'SDL2', 'SDL2\_image' and 'SDL2\_ttf'.
6. Finally, run the batch file CompileAndRun.bat with ```.\CompileAndRun```
* It is not needed to be run again to execute the program, you can access the executable directly inside Build/Release
